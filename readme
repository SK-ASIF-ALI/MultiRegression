We are using a dummy variable to perform multi-regression
in the dataset consists of SAT,GPA,attendance
Attandance is a cateogircal data.
We will insert yes if attendance is >60 otherwise
no
we need to convert the cateogorical data into numeric data or raw data
we will use python mapping tecnique to perform the conversion the attendance column yes=1 and no=0 will be converted
we use data.describe() to get the swat of the data
we need to calculate GPA based on the SAT score and the attandance.
