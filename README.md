# Regression
We have use both types of regression an multi-regression using a dataset of stuents contains sat score,attendance,gpa.

Needs:
This directory contains a .ipynb file which needs to execute in jupyter-notebook.
we have also used the following packages,which needs to be installed in your machine: 
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import statsmodels.api as sm
import pandas as pd

1.In first scenario we have use a linear regression using gpa and sat score
2.In second scenario we have used multi-regression to calculate gpa by using sat score attenance an gpa.
3.We have also used a test data prediction  in the last section of the code.



For the Further info about the code,please open the notebook file.

If any issue.....Ping me by raising the issue,


Thanking you
